2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gsclk_0_0 relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0, clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on latch_0_0 relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0, clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sclk_0_0 relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0, clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sout_0_0 relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0, clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>
