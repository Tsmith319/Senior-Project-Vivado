LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/top_0/inst/LAT_INST_0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[0]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[10]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[11]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[12]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[13]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[14]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[15]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[1]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[2]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[3]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[4]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[5]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[6]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[7]/CLR, design_1_i/top_0/inst/next_gs_counter_reg[8]/CLR (the first 15 of 20 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
